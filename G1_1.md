# NADA

## Brief

We don't know how, but DotGant has used an astronaut's old account to infiltrate our satellites and erase all of the logs. We recovered the first part of their new password: CPC. Use this to your advantage. We've also extracted a part of the content they modified. The clock is ticking, find the full password and help us dig deeper.

## Solution

New Password: CPC-ABS-JBI

* CPC from brief
* ABS from the ad on the top right "Get Astronaut-like Abs!"
* JBI from paragraph on center of page "James Benson Irwin"

## Success Message

Excellent extraction, Codebreaker. Now that we have the full password, we can take back control oft eh hacked astronaut's account, so DotGang won't be able to use it to access the NADA satellite anymore.

# Nabster

## Brief

We intercepted communication that revealed DotGang's plan to inject a virus into Nabster downloads. Have you heard of this software? It's absurd, a place to share compressed music files through the Internet. There is no way the public would be interested in something like this. But we need to get ahead of it, so begin your next mission and do whatever you can to identify this virus.

## Solution

Software is pending an upgrade, notice all of the "upgrade" messages laying around the UI.
* Secret message, first letter of every song in `OldiesButGoldies` playlist spells **UPGRADEVERSION**

### Not sure what the solution is yet, will resume woring later...

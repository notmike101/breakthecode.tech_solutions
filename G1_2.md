# Nabster

## Brief

We intercepted communication that revealed DotGang's plan to inject a virus into Nabster downloads. Have you heard of this software? It's absurd, a place to share compressed music files through the Internet. There is no way the public would be interested in something like this. But we need to get ahead of it, so begin your next mission and do whatever you can to identify this virus.

## Solution

TBD
